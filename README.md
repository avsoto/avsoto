### Hi, I'm Ana Soto 👋👩🏾‍💻

I like to make design proposals come true to solve any problem by applying my knowledge oriented to web development.

I'm proactive, with a huge sense of responsability and commitment, with a good adaptability to any kind of work changes, predisposition to constantly learning, sharing knowledge because I believe that you learn a lot from the experience of other colleagues, as well as having feedback.


Some technologies I master:
