## üòä Hi, I'm Ana Victoria Soto Mej√≠a

### :octocat: About Me

Passionate about creating solutions that improve people's lives through efficient and secure software, I specialize in backend development with a solid foundation in Software Engineering. I am proficient in languages like JavaScript, PHP, and I am currently expanding my skills in Java.

I have experience with SQL databases, such as MySQL, optimizing data management through efficient queries and ensuring data integrity. I have worked under agile methodologies like SCRUM, collaborating in multidisciplinary teams to achieve goals in a structured and adaptive manner.

Additionally, I possess a comprehensive understanding of the software development life cycle, including designing intuitive interfaces using tools like Figma, Illustrator, and Adobe XD. This background allows me to deeply understand the connection between frontend and backend, ensuring optimal integration.
